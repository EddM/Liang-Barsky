# Liang-Barsky

This is an implementation of the [Liang-Barsky](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liang%E2%80%93Barsky) line clipping algorithm I hacked together when developing a game. Thought it might be useful to others.

(Note: Differs from traditional implementations in that the origin is in the top left corner, not bottom left. This makes this implementation more appropriate for game development -- for example using [Gosu](http://www.libgosu.org)).
